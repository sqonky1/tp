### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete i/1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete i/1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete i/1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, `LogicManager` passes the user input to `AddressBookParser`.
1. `AddressBookParser` identifies the command word and delegates to the corresponding parser (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) to construct a `Command` object.
1. `LogicManager` executes the command against the `Model`.
1. If the command is undoable (`command.isUndoable()`), `LogicManager` pushes it to an internal undo history stack.
1. If the command is `undo`, `LogicManager` handles it directly by invoking `undo(model)` on the most recent undoable command in that history stack. More details on the undo feature are provided in the [Undo feature](#undo-feature) section under Implementation.
1. After command execution, `LogicManager` persists changes through `Storage`, then returns a `CommandResult` to the caller.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* `AddressBookParser` routes each command to an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name, e.g., `AddCommandParser`) that validates input and creates an `XYZCommand` object.
* Commands with no parameters (`list`, `clear`, `exit`, `undo`) are validated directly in `AddressBookParser`; any extra arguments are rejected.
* Most command parsers use `ArgumentTokenizer` and `ParserUtil` helpers to enforce:
  * required/optional prefixes,
  * duplicate-prefix checks for single-valued fields,
  * detection of invalid or unexpected prefixes,
  * command-specific constraints (e.g., exactly one of `i/` or `e/` for `delete`).
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes implement the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* A person is considered a duplicate if another person already has the same email, or the same Telegram handle ignoring case.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefsStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

**Adapter pattern for JSON serialization**

The `Storage` component uses an adapter pattern to bridge between the domain model and JSON representation. Three adapter classes handle the conversion:

* `JsonSerializableAddressBook` — wraps the entire address book for serialization; its `toModelType()` method converts back to a `ReadOnlyAddressBook`, checking for duplicate persons in the process.
* `JsonAdaptedPerson` — represents a single `Person` in JSON form. The fields `phone` and `telegramHandle` are optional (nullable); `name` and `email` are required. `toModelType()` validates each field and throws `IllegalValueException` if any value is invalid.
* `JsonAdaptedTag` — represents a single `Tag`, storing both `tagName` and `tagType`.

**JSON data format**

Data is stored in two JSON files:

* `data/addressbook.json` — contact list:
  ```json
  {
    "addressbook": {
      "persons": [
        {
          "name": "Alex Yeoh",
          "phone": "87438807",
          "email": "alexyeoh@example.com",
          "telegramHandle": "alexyeoh",
          "tags": [{ "tagName": "cs2103t", "tagType": "COURSE" }]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
* `preferences.json` — GUI window size/position and the address book file path:
  ```json
  {
    "guiSettings": {
      "windowWidth": 740.0, 
      "windowHeight": 574.0, 
      "windowCoordinates": { 
        "x": 100, 
        "y": 100 
      } 
    },
    "addressBookFilePath": "data/addressbook.json"
  }
  ```

**Error handling on startup**

When CampusBridge starts, it attempts to read the address book file and handles three cases:
* **File not found** — sample data is loaded and the file is created on the next save or exit.
* **File is malformed or contains invalid data** — an empty address book is used and a warning is logged; the corrupted file is left untouched.
* **File is valid** — data is loaded normally.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add feature

#### Implementation

The `add` command is implemented using `AddCommandParser` and `AddCommand`.

When the user enters an `add` command, `AddressBookParser` delegates the input to `AddCommandParser`. `AddCommandParser` tokenizes the input using only the prefixes supported by `add`: `n/`, `e/`, `p/`, and `h/`.

The parser enforces the following rules:

* `n/NAME` and `e/EMAIL` are compulsory.
* `p/PHONE` and `h/TELEGRAM_HANDLE` are optional.
* Values are trimmed before validation.
* Repeated single-valued prefixes are rejected.
* Any non-empty preamble is rejected.
* Any unexpected slash-prefixed token is rejected as extra input. This includes prefixes from other commands such as `t/`, `tr/`, `tc/`, `tg/`, `i/`, `o/`, and `r/`, as well as unknown prefixes such as `x/`.
* `Name` validation allows only letters, numbers, spaces, and these symbols: `(` `)` `.` `-` `,` `'`.
* Other special characters are intentionally rejected. In particular, `/` is not supported because `/` is used by the CLI prefix-based syntax and may create parsing ambiguity. If a real-world name uses `/`, users should enter a supported substitute such as `-` instead (e.g. `D/O` as `D-O`).

After tokenization, `AddCommandParser` uses `ParserUtil` to validate and convert each supplied value into the corresponding model type. It then constructs a `Person` object and returns an `AddCommand`.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for a typical successful `add` command.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add n/John e/john@gmail.com` Command](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

When `AddCommand` executes, it first checks for duplicate conflicts using `model.getDuplicateConflict(toAdd)`. If a duplicate email, duplicate Telegram handle, or both are detected, the command fails. Otherwise, the person is added to the model and a `CommandResult` is returned. If the added person's email is not an NUS-domain email, the success message also includes a warning.

`AddCommand` is undoable. Undoing an `add` removes the previously added person, unless that person no longer exists in the model.

#### Duplicate detection

Duplicate detection for `add` is based on `Person#isSamePerson(...)`.

Two persons are considered the same person if they have:

* the same email, or
* the same non-null Telegram handle.

This identity rule is used by `UniquePersonList` when adding and updating persons. As a result, the `add` command rejects contacts that duplicate either an existing email or an existing Telegram handle.

### Undo feature

#### Implementation

The undo feature is implemented using the Command pattern, where each undoable command encapsulates its own undo logic. The overall undo process is managed by `LogicManager`.

When an undoable command is executed, it is added to an internal stack (`undoHistory : Deque<Command>`) maintained by `LogicManager`.

When the `undo` command is invoked, `LogicManager` retrieves the most recent command from `undoHistory` using `peek()`. The `undo(Model)` method of that command is then executed to revert its effects. If the undo operation is successful, the command is removed from the stack using `pop()`.

This design ensures that each command is responsible for reversing its own changes, providing flexibility and adhering to the Command pattern.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the undo operation is executed:

![UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

The following class diagram shows the simplified structure of the undo feature:

![UndoClassDiagram](images/UndoClassDiagram.png)

The following Activity diagram illustrates the control flow of command execution in the undo feature.

![UndoActivityDiagram.png](images/UndoActivityDiagram.png)

Note: Undo methods in commands directly interact with the `Model` to revert changes. Hence, we are not having an object diagram here. UI and Storage components are omitted from the diagrams as they are not directly involved in the undo mechanism.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How undo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 :** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Individual command knows how to undo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. Changes should be implemented incrementally, i.e. in a way that allows the app to be usable after each increment, even if some features are not yet implemented.
5. All logics and storage should be implemented locally, to ensure testability and usability in secure environments without internet access.
6. The distributed JAR file should not be bloated, preferably less than 10MB, to ensure that it can be easily downloaded and stored on devices with limited storage.

### Glossary

* Brownfield project: A software project developed upon an existing codebase, rather than starting from scratch.
* CLI (Command-line interface): A text-based user interface where users type specific commands to interact with the application or OS.
* Command: A text instruction entered by the user (e.g. `add`, `delete`, `edit`) that triggers a specific action in the application.
* Course: An academic course offered at NUS, identified by a unique course code (e.g. CS2103T, CS2101).
* Course tag: A type of tag (displayed in blue) used to label a contact with an NUS course code. Its prefix is `tc/`.
* Duplicate person: A contact is considered a duplicate if another contact already has the same email OR the same non-empty Telegram handle (case-insensitive for handles).
* Fuzzy matching: A search technique used in the `find` command that allows for minor typos or substrings rather than requiring an exact character-for-character match.
* General tag: A type of tag (displayed in red) for any user-defined label. Its prefix is `tg/`.
* Groupmate: A fellow student who collaborates with you on academic projects, assignments, or study groups within the same module.
* GUI (Graphical user interface): A visual way for users to interact with digital components through items like icons and buttons.
* Index: A positive integer representing the position of a contact in the currently displayed list.
* Mainstream OS: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS.
* NUS domain: Email addresses ending with `@u.nus.edu` (student), `@nus.edu.sg` (staff), or `@*.nus.edu.sg`.
* Prefix: A short identifier (e.g. `n/`, `e/`, `tg/`) used in commands to denote the type of parameter that follows.
* Professor: An academic staff member who teaches a course at NUS.
* Role tag: A type of tag (displayed in green) used to label a contact's academic role. Its prefix is `tr/`.
* Tag: A label attached to a contact for categorization.
* Teaching Assistant (TA): A graduate or undergraduate student who assists with teaching duties, including conducting tutorials and grading assignments.
* Undoable command: A command (e.g. `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `tag`) that can be reversed using the `undo` command. Commands like `list` and `find` are not undoable.
* Undo history stack: An internal data structure that stores previous commands, allowing the user to revert changes in reverse chronological order.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Challenges faced
- Architectural onboarding: As TP is a brownfield project, significant time was spent tracing the codebase and understanding existing design patterns.
- Team coordination and synchronization: Working in a shared codebase made it challenging to track concurrent changes and maintain consistency across contributions.
- Technical ambiguity: The team had to resolve uncertainties about the most appropriate way to implement features and standardize error messages across modules.
- Complex undo logic: Implementing the undo feature required bespoke handling for each command type to ensure state changes could be reversed correctly across different scenarios.
- Refactoring and redundancy: The team also had to identify duplicated code and extract reusable logic into shared helper classes.

### Effort required
- Rigorous testing and quality assurance: Substantial effort was devoted to designing and executing test cases that covered many input permutations and uncovered edge-case bugs.
- Comprehensive error handling: Beyond implementing features, the team invested significant effort in thorough validation and in deciding how errors should be handled and communicated to users.
- Exhaustive code reviews: Team members carefully reviewed one another’s pull requests to avoid duplicated work and ensure the implementation was sound.

### Achievements
- Data integrity and robustness: Successfully navigated complex data permutations (valid/invalid assignments, duplicate handling) to ensure a stable system.
- Refined logic and refactoring: The team turned individual contributions into a cohesive whole through active refactoring and the introduction of generalized utility classes.
- Successful system extension: The team successfully adapted to and extended a large existing codebase.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 6

We identified 5 planned enhancements in total, including several currently unfixable limitations and bugs.

1. Improve copy usability<br>
   Copying currently requires two clicks because of the existing UI design, which presents information as a panel of cards and fields. Users must first select the card, then select the specific field to copy. A possible future improvement would be to redesign the UI structure so that copying can be done more efficiently.

2. Reduce noise in fuzzy search results<br>
   The current `find` command uses fuzzy search, which can return irrelevant matches. For example, if both *Robert* and *Hubert* exist in the address book, searching for either name may return both entries. A future enhancement would be to prioritise exact matches whenever both exact and fuzzy matches are available.

3. Handle edge cases involving special characters in search<br>
   The `find` command may behave unexpectedly when search keywords contain special characters. This is more noticeable in some name queries such as `find n/ale\x`. Email and tag searches do not currently provide additional handling for such cases. A future enhancement could introduce clearer validation rules and more consistent handling of special characters across name, email, and tag searches.

4. Allow spaces and selected special characters in tags<br>
   Currently, tags do not support spaces or special characters. We plan to enhance flexibility by allowing spaces and commonly used characters such as hyphens and underscores, making tags more expressive and practical.

5. Provide clearer undo feedback in filtered views<br>
   Currently, if a user edits, tags, untags, or clears tags for a person and then applies a filter using `find`, that person may disappear from the filtered list. If the user later performs `undo`, the person’s previous state is correctly restored in the address book, but the active filtered view remains unchanged. As a result, the restored person may still not appear, which can make it seem as though `undo` failed. A planned enhancement is to improve the undo feedback message so users understand that the undo was successful, but the current filter is still being applied.
