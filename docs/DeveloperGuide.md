### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete i/1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* A person is considered a duplicate if another person already has the same email, or the same Telegram handle ignoring case.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefsStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

**Adapter pattern for JSON serialization**

The `Storage` component uses an adapter pattern to bridge between the domain model and JSON representation. Three adapter classes handle the conversion:

* `JsonSerializableAddressBook` — wraps the entire address book for serialization; its `toModelType()` method converts back to a `ReadOnlyAddressBook`, checking for duplicate persons in the process.
* `JsonAdaptedPerson` — represents a single `Person` in JSON form. The fields `phone` and `telegramHandle` are optional (nullable); `name` and `email` are required. `toModelType()` validates each field and throws `IllegalValueException` if any value is invalid.
* `JsonAdaptedTag` — represents a single `Tag`, storing both `tagName` and `tagType`.

**JSON data format**

Data is stored in two JSON files:

* `data/addressbook.json` — contact list:
  ```json
  {
    "addressbook": {
      "persons": [
        {
          "name": "Alex Yeoh",
          "phone": "87438807",
          "email": "alexyeoh@example.com",
          "telegramHandle": "alexyeoh",
          "tags": [{ "tagName": "cs2103t", "tagType": "COURSE" }]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
* `preferences.json` — GUI window size/position and the address book file path:
  ```json
  {
    "guiSettings": { "windowWidth": 740.0, "windowHeight": 574.0, "windowCoordinates": { "x": 100, "y": 100 } },
    "addressBookFilePath": "data/addressbook.json"
  }
  ```

**Error handling on startup**

When CampusBridge starts, it attempts to read the address book file and handles three cases:
* **File not found** — sample data is loaded and the file is created on the next save.
* **File is malformed or contains invalid data** — an empty address book is used and a warning is logged; the corrupted file is left untouched.
* **File is valid** — data is loaded normally.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add feature

#### Implementation

The `add` command is implemented using `AddCommandParser` and `AddCommand`.

When the user enters an `add` command, `AddressBookParser` delegates the input to `AddCommandParser`. `AddCommandParser` tokenizes the input using only the prefixes supported by `add`: `n/`, `e/`, `p/`, and `h/`.

The parser enforces the following rules:

* `n/NAME` and `e/EMAIL` are compulsory.
* `p/PHONE` and `h/TELEGRAM_HANDLE` are optional.
* Values are trimmed before validation.
* Repeated single-valued prefixes are rejected.
* Any non-empty preamble is rejected.
* Known prefixes belonging to other commands, such as `t/`, `tr/`, `tc/`, `tg/`, `i/`, `o/`, and `r/`, are treated as unexpected extra input in an `add` command.

After tokenization, `AddCommandParser` uses `ParserUtil` to validate and convert each supplied value into the corresponding model type. It then constructs a `Person` object and returns an `AddCommand`.

When `AddCommand` executes, it first checks whether the person already exists in the address book using `model.hasPerson(toAdd)`. If a duplicate is detected, the command fails.

If the person is unique, the command adds the person to the model and returns a success message. If the added person's email is not an NUS-domain email, the command still succeeds but appends a warning message.

`AddCommand` is undoable. Undoing an `add` removes the previously added person, unless that person no longer exists in the model.

#### Duplicate detection

Duplicate detection for `add` is based on `Person#isSamePerson(...)`.

Two persons are considered the same person if they have:

* the same email, or
* the same non-null Telegram handle.

This identity rule is used by `UniquePersonList` when adding and updating persons. As a result, the `add` command rejects contacts that duplicate either an existing email or an existing Telegram handle.

### Current Undo feature

#### Current Implementation

Currently, the undo feature is implemented in each undoable commands, and is now handled by LogicManager.

Undoable commands, once executed, will be added in to a deque.

When an undo command is called, the deque will peek at the first item to be out.

If the undo of the command is successfully executed, the deque will pop.

Here is the sequence UML diagram:![UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png]
Note: Undo methods in commands now directly calls methods in Model to revert the changes.

More UML diagrams are to be added in a later.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:
NUS undergraduate students who
* Need to organize contact information of their Professors, Teaching Assistants and Groupmates.
* Values efficiency and prefers tools that save time and reduce friction.
* Prefer using CLI over GUI.

**Value proposition**:
CampusBridge helps NUS undergraduate students to organize and access contact information for their academic peers across different modules and faculties.

It does so by providing a centralized, easy-to-use system to save, search, and manage academic contacts efficiently.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. Changes should be implemented incrementally, i.e. in a way that allows the app to be usable after each increment, even if some features are not yet implemented.
5. All logics and storage should be implemented locally, to ensure testability and usability in secure environments without internet access.
6. The distributed JAR file should not be bloated, preferably less than 10MB, to ensure that it can be easily downloaded and stored on devices with limited storage.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS
* **Private contact detail**: A contact detail that is not meant to be shared with others
